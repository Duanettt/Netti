## How to Use

As of September 2024, **Netti Studio** is primarily set up for use with **Visual Studio**. I am actively working on adding **CMake** support to make the project more versatile across platforms and development environments.

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netpix.git
   ```

2. **Open in Visual Studio:**
   * Open the `solution.sln` file in Visual Studio.

3. **Build and Run:**
   * Select your configuration (e.g., `x64/Debug`) and build the project.
   * Run the game directly from Visual Studio.

I will update this section with CMake instructions once it's ready for cross-platform development.
